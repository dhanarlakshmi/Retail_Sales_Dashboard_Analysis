## 💡 Key Findings and Business Insights
Based on the dashboard, the following insights were derived:

* **Regional Dominance:** The **South region** is the top performer, accounting for the largest share of sales at **$577.67K (31.78%)**. This area should be analyzed to understand successful strategies that can be replicated.
* **Focus on High-Value Customers:** **CUST047** is the highest-contributing customer, responsible for **$124K** in sales. Retention efforts should be prioritized for this and other top-tier customers (CUST016, CUST026).
* **Area for Growth:** The **North region** has the lowest sales contribution at $396.05K (21.79%). This suggests a potential area for targeted marketing campaigns or operational review.

## ✅ Next Steps & Recommendations
1.  Investigate the product mix sold in the South region to understand the specific drivers of its high performance.
2.  Develop a custom loyalty program for the top 5 contributing Customer IDs.
3.  Conduct a deep-dive profit and margin analysis on the North region's transactions.
